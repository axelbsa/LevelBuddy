# Matt Lucas's Level Buddy
<https://matt-lucas.itch.io/level-buddy>

### Original description
Level Buddy is a CSG level modeling workflow add on for Blender 3D. It takes inspiration from old school editors like UnrealEd and DoomED. Level Buddy reduces iteration time while letting you test out ideas quickly and easily. 

### Port notes
I've ported this version from someone else's version, who ported it for some version who again ... it's gone through some people. I've fixed up some things that didn't work for blender 4.2 LTS so atleast it runs there. I gave it a quick test in blender 4.5 LTS and also "seems" to work, but i only tested some super simple levels. I did restructure the code a little so it follows the same paradigms as other blender addons, however that is mostly just moving code around. Use at your own risk. License is whatever the original creator and blender foundation requests.
